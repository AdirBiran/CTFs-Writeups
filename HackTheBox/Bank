enumeration
*1

editing hosts file with the domain
10.10.10.29	bank.htb

checking the website leads to login page
*2

running gobuster twice:
once with directory search
*3
second with .php extensions search
*4

assets directory did not lead to something interesting
uploads directory wasn't reachable
inc directory had a few php files, thought nothing useful.
5*

trying to investigate the php files from the gobuster results,
we will try reach index.php file with the help of burpsuite.

Opened burpsuite, turned on foxyproxy and entered
http://bank.htb/index.php to intercept the request and response.
in burpsuite we will intercept the response to this request and forward the request.
*6
changing the 302 to 200 in the reponse and forwarding it, will result in the following index.php page on the web:
*7
*8

not much to see here, but following this method we of changing the 302 status to 200 we'll investigate the support.php file as well.
*9
we reached a page which contains a file upload, so lets try get a reverse php shell.
10*

exploitation

apparantly the php extension is not allowed to upload.
*11

checking the source code of the support.php page, lead to this comment:
*12

lets try the .htb extension instead.
*13

looks like the shell.htb was accepted.
*14

lets open a netcat listener and nevigate to bank.htb/uploads/shell.htb to execute the reverse shell.
and we're in as www-data
*15

privilege escelation
after basic manual enumeration of suid files, executables, crontab and a few more, decided to run linpeas for faster results.
getting linpeas from the local machine to the /tmp directory and chaning its permissions.
*16

linpeas results showed the /etc/passwd file is writeable.
*17

checking the file permissions:
*18

on the local machine we'll create a password for the /etc/passwd file using the command:
perl -le 'print crypt("pass", "anything")'
*19

adding the new root user through the /etc/passwd file:
echo "root2:an5CaYOk82Zq6:0:0:root2:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
*19

as we can see, the new user was added successfully.
*20

chaging to the root2 user using the "pass" password.
*21

and we're root.
